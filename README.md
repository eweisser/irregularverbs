# irregularverbs

This webpage is for practicing the simple past and past participle forms of irregular verbs in English. There are two modes: one which presents the user with random verbs one at a time, and another which presents the user with a chart containing all (root) irregular verbs, with blank spaces for the user to fill in the simple past and past participles.
